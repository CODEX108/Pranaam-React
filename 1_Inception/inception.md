### What is Emmet?
Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor that allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. By using Emmet, email designers type less, saving both keystrokes and time when building a campaign. Also, relying on Emmet’s autocompletion means fewer typos and missing tags, leading to more robust emails.

### React's Clinent APIs / Client React DOM APIs
The react-dom/client APIs let you render React components on the client (in the browser). These APIs are typically used at the top level of your app to initialize your React tree. A framework may call them for you. Most of your components don’t need to import or use them.

Client APIs 
createRoot lets you create a root to display React components inside a browser DOM node.
hydrateRoot lets you display React components inside a browser DOM node whose HTML content was previously generated by react-dom/server.

### what is a CDN ?
A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications. CDN can stand for content delivery network or content distribution network. When a user visits a website, data from that website's server has to travel across the internet to reach the user's computer. If the user is located far from that server, it will take a long time to load a large file, such as a video or website image. Instead, the website content is stored on CDN servers geographically closer to the users and reaches their computers much faster.

### How does a CDN work?
Content delivery networks (CDNs) work by establishing a point of presence (POP) or a group of CDN edge servers at multiple geographical locations. This geographically distributed network works on the principles of caching, dynamic acceleration, and edge logic computations.
- Caching
Caching is the process of storing multiple copies of the same data for faster data access.
- Dynamic acceleration
Dynamic acceleration is the reduction in server response time for dynamic web content requests because of an intermediary CDN server between the web applications and the client.In this case the other hand, if the nearby CDN server forwards the request to the origin server, they would already have an ongoing, trusted connection established. For example, the following features could further optimize the connection between them:

        -Intelligent routing algorithms
        -Geographic proximity to the origin
        -The ability to process the client request, which reduces its size

- Edge logic computations
You can program the CDN edge server to perform logical computations that simplify communication between the client and server. For example, this server can do the following:
        -Inspect user requests and modify caching behavior.
        -Validate and handle incorrect user requests.
        -Modify or optimize content before responding.

### What is a `crossorigin`?
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP feature that enables a web application running under one domain to access resources in another domain. CORS headers specify which domains are allowed to access resources on the origin website. A cross-origin request is a request for website resources external to the origin. CORS instructs the browser to determine if a cross-origin request, such as an image or JavaScript from `b.secondexample.com`, is allowed by `a.example.com`. CORS is an essential component when files (e.g. fonts or JavaScript) are loaded from another domain (e.g. a CDN) other than the website. CORS adds HTTP headers which instruct web browsers on how to use and manage cross-domain content. The browser then allows or denies access to the content based on its security configuration.

### React is a library and not a framework 
- It can work inside a small part of your code as well , it is not a full fleged framework , React is a barebone minimal javascript library. 
- React is just JS, it just gives us some helper methods , In React we don't need to createa whole app it can be applied dto an existing app by just injecting CND links.

### How does the oder of script tags matter?
- The order of script tags in an HTML file can have a significant impact on how your JavaScript code behaves. When you're including external libraries like React and your own application code, the order matters because the browser processes the scripts in the order they appear in the HTML file. Let me explain why the order you described matters:
- `React Library` (react.development.js): This contains the React core functionality. It needs to be loaded before any code that uses React components, otherwise, those components will not be recognized.
- `React DOM Library` (react-dom.development.js): This library is responsible for rendering React components into the browser's DOM. Like the React library, it needs to be loaded before any code that renders React components.
- Your `Application Code` (app.js): This is where you're writing your own React components and application logic. This code should be loaded after the React and React DOM libraries so that it can use the features provided by these libraries.
